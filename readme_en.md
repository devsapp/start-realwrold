# Plugin development instructions

> The development of Serverless Devs plugin is strictly in line with the [plugin model specification](https://github.com/Serverless-Devs/Serverless-Devs/tree/master/spec/en/0.0.2/serverless_package_model/3.package_model.md#Plugin-model-specification) in [Serverless Package Model](https://github.com/Serverless-Devs/Serverless-Devs/tree/master/spec/en/0.0.2/serverless_package_model/readme.md). In the [plugin model specification](https://github.com/Serverless-Devs/Serverless-Devs/tree/master/spec/en/0.0.2/serverless_package_model/3.package_model.md#Plugin-model-specification), the instructions on [plugin model metadata](https://github.com/Serverless-Devs/Serverless-Devs/tree/master/spec/en/0.0.2/serverless_package_model/3.package_model.md#Plugin-model-specification) and [plugin model code specification](https://github.com/Serverless-Devs/Serverless-Devs/tree/master/spec/en/0.0.2/serverless_package_model/3.package_model.md#Plugin-model-metadata) are described. 

The component development cases of Serverless Devs are integrated into the Serverless Devs CLI tool. You can use the CLI tool to initialize a plugin project that is not developed. Developers only need to run the `s init` command, and the following command output is returned:

```shell script

üöÄ Serverless Awesome: https://github.com/Serverless-Devs/package-awesome

? Hello Serverless for Cloud Vendors (Use arrow keys or type to search)
‚ùØ Alibaba Cloud Serverless 
  AWS Cloud Serverless 
  Tencent Cloud Serverless 
  Baidu Cloud Serverless 
  Dev Template for Serverless Devs 
```

Select the last line `Dev Template for Serverless Devs` and press the Enter key. The following command output is returned: 

```shell script
$ s init

üöÄ Serverless Awesome: https://github.com/Serverless-Devs/package-awesome

? Hello Serverless for Cloud Vendors Dev Template for Serverless Devs
? Please select an Serverless-Devs Application (Use arrow keys or type to search)
‚ùØ Application Scaffolding 
  Component Scaffolding 
  Plugin Scaffolding 
```

Select `Plugin Scaffolding` and press the Enter key. The project of a Serverless Devs component is initialized. You can run the following command to view the file tree:

```shell script
$ find . -print | sed -e 's;[^/]*/;|____;g;s;____|; |;g'
.
|____LICENSE
|____.signore
|____example
| |____s.yaml
|____readme.md
|____publish.yaml
|____.gitignore
|____package.json
|____src
| |____common
| | |____entity.ts
| | |____logger.ts
| |____index.ts
```

The following table describes the directories in the file tree.

| Directory     | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| LICENSE       | The default license for the project. The  default license follows the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) open  source protocol. We recommend that you use the default license. |
| .signore      | The file that can be ignored in your  package when you publish a project. The .signore file is similar to the .npmignore file that you can use to keep the ignored file out of your  package when you publish npm packages. |
| example       | The test application of the component.                       |
| publish.yaml  | The file that is required for the project.  The file is identifiable for developers of the Serverless Devs Package. |
| .gitignore    | The file that can be ignored when the  project is committed to GitHub. |
| package.json  | The package.json file of the Node.js  runtime environment. The detailed position of the plugin handler is  described in the file. |
| src           | The directory that is used to store the  source code files of users. |
| readme.md     | The description of the project version,  such as the updates of the current version. |


Developers can use the code in the src directory for development. By default, the initialization project is a TypeScript project. This way, developers need to run the `npm run build` command to compile the code into JavaScript. After the code of the project is compiled into JavaScript, developers also need to write the `publish.yaml` file. After the preceding operations are complete, you can commit the project to different sources. For example, if you want to commit the project to GitHub Registry, you can create a repository named `Public` in GitHub, store the compiled code into the repository, and then publish a version. In this case, the application is available on Serverless Devs clients.
